# C/C++ Game
My final for Programming 1!! We were tasked with making a multiplayer game that had a lot of replay value.  
The game had to be made within a broken OpenGL framework, so it gave us some experience working with trying to make sense of older code that wasn't our own.  
  


# About the Game
The game we ended up creating was an infinite runner, where the goal is to outlast the other player while using power ups/downs to help you or hurt your opponent.

# Video 
Here is a video of the game in action:
