# C/C++ Game
My final for Programming 1!! We were tasked with making a muliplayer game that was multiplayer and had a lot of replayability.  
The game had to be made within a partically broken OpenGL framework, so it gave us some experince working with trying to make sense of older code that wasn't our own.  


# About the Game
The game we ended up creating was an infinite runner, where the goal is to outlast the other player while using power ups/downs to help you or hurt your opponent.

# Video 
Here is a video of the game in action:
